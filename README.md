React Address Book Exercise

The user interface (UI) should:
- Include a visible contact list 
- Include the functionality to create, edit and delete contacts. 

The address book should capture the following information for each contact: 
- Name 
- Address Line 1
- Address Line 2
- Town/City
- County
- Postcode
- Telephone 
- Email.

The address book needs to utilise the open source postcode lookup service https://postcodes.io/. 
Please use this free service to validate the postcode and populate with applicable address information 
(note: this service doesnât return full address details, please take what makes sense)
